# Chat Application

A simple real-time chat application built using **Next.js**, **Socket.IO**, **Redis**, and **Express**. Authentication is handled with **NextAuth**. This application allows users to create password-protected chat rooms, share the room links, and chat securely within the rooms.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Login securely using NextAuth.
- **Room Creation**: Authenticated users can create chat rooms with a unique name and a password.
- **Secure Room Access**: Users must enter their name and the correct room password to join a chat room.
- **Real-Time Chat**: Messages are exchanged in real-time using Socket.IO.
- **Scalability**: Redis is used to store and manage session data and room information.

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js**: Frontend framework for server-side rendering and seamless integration with APIs.
- **Socket.IO**: Enables real-time, bidirectional communication between clients and the server.
- **Redis**: Used as a fast and reliable in-memory data store for managing chat rooms and session data.
- **Express**: Backend framework for handling API routes and WebSocket connections.
- **NextAuth**: Provides authentication mechanisms for the app.

   # Socket.IO
   SOCKET_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:3000
   ```

4. **Start the Redis server**:

   Ensure Redis is running on your machine. Use the following command to start it:

   ```bash
   redis-server
   ```

5. **Run the development server**:

   ```bash
   bun dev
   ```
